# Pet Safe Zone

This is a simple app that helps you keep track of your pets when you're out and about. You set up safe zones on a map (like your home, the park, or grandma's house), and then track where your cat or dog is with their GPS collar. The app lets you know if your pet wanders outside these safe areas, so you can relax knowing they're where they should be. It's basically like having a virtual fence for your furry friends, giving you peace of mind while they explore.
BTW: my cat name is Tim.
